Hello Git and GitHub
My take on the project is to generate random wanted adds, such as:
Wanted: Phone repair mechanic. In possession of dry-erase pens. Good at keeping children quiet. Call Joe @ 555-123 4567.

It picks a job title from an array, then something the applicant needs to possess to qualify, and finally some skill they should have. 

This program recreates a game I used play as a kid. We had a box of cards in three colors with the type of information that I programmed into the arrays. We combined the cards to create wacky job descriptions. It always made me laugh, just like this program.
